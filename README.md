#Description
I designed a Smart Home Automation App UI in Figma, focusing on a modern, user-friendly, and functional interface. The app allows users to monitor home devices, control lighting, and automate schedules with ease.

The home dashboard includes a personalized greeting, a weather widget displaying the current temperature and conditions, and a room/device management section where users can toggle devices ON/OFF. The bottom navigation bar features icons for home, voice assistant, and settings to enhance usability.

The smart lighting control screen provides an interactive UI for managing lights. Users can adjust brightness (displayed as 20%), set automation schedules (e.g., 12:00 AM & 1:20 PM), and control lighting using voice commands, represented by a microphone icon with sound wave effects. A realistic hanging lamp image enhances the visual appeal.

To ensure a clean and modern aesthetic, I used a blue & white theme, rounded corners, and soft shadows. Icons and typography were carefully selected for clarity and accessibility. The layout was structured using Auto Layout in Figma for responsiveness.

For prototyping, I created interactive elements, including toggle switch animations, hover effects on the microphone icon, and smooth transitions for a more dynamic experience.
